Progress:
- Reflected on work session feedback and made corrective adjustments to narrow project scope around clearly defined coaching decisions.
- Met briefly with Jay Flores and refined the focus toward player utility, role definition, lineup fit, and substitution impact rather than broad team-level reporting.
- Translated stakeholder feedback into predefined analytical use cases (player grading, substitution-level impact, lineup performance comparisons, conference peer rankings).
- Fully stabilized data loading pipeline; all major datasets now load programmatically without manual CSV handling.
- Continued standardizing ingestion, cleaning, and transformation scripts so the system operates as one cohesive pipeline.
- Began developing analytical layers on top of the cleaned dataset, including early work on player grading logic and substitution impact breakdowns.
- Improved GitHub structure and commit organization to better reflect production-style workflow and long-term scalability.

Problems:
- Project scope still presents risk of overexpansion due to the large number of potential analytical directions.
- Some advanced metrics require careful interpretation and documentation before being used in player grading logic.
- Transfer portal modeling remains conceptually valuable but difficult to operationalize due to uncertainty around player availability and movement timing.

Plans:
- Finalize initial version of player grading framework using role-based and efficiency-based metrics.
- Develop substitution impact analysis to quantify lineup performance changes when specific players enter or exit.
- Continue refining analytical outputs so the dashboard clearly answers a small set of high-value coaching questions.
- Prepare a simplified explanation of supported decisions to improve clarity for non-basketball audiences.

Progress:
- Met with Jay Flores and gained clearer direction on project priorities, shifting focus toward player utility and fit rather than solely team-level performance.
- Clarified emphasis on evaluating players through lineup context, role-based performance, conference and league rankings, and peer comparisons.
- Discussed longer-term potential for the project to support recruiting and transfer portal evaluation through shared, standardized analytics across teams.
- Agreed that prioritizing publicly available data sources will improve scalability and allow the tool to be used beyond UM-specific internal data.
- Began refining long-term GitHub structure and end-state vision, including cleaner commits, clearer action plans, and improved project organization.
- Continued significant coding work focused on data loading and scraping to reduce reliance on manually uploaded CSV files.
- Advanced style guide and coding conventions to improve readability, consistency, and maintainability across data ingestion scripts.

Problems:
- Programmatic data loading and scraping from sources like Sports Reference presents challenges due to access constraints, formatting inconsistencies, and the need to follow usage rules carefully.
- Transfer portal analytics remain conceptually valuable but difficult to operationalize due to uncertainty around player availability and timing.
- Balancing near-term prototype development with longer-term scalability requires careful prioritization.

Plans:
- Continue developing automated data ingestion workflows that minimize manual data handling while respecting source limitations.
- Translate player utility and fit concepts into measurable, transparent metrics using publicly available data.
- Explore feasible ways to represent transfer portal value through historical movement patterns, role fit, and performance comparables.
- Further clean and document repository structure to align with long-term project vision and external collaboration.

2026-02-02
Progress:
- Finalized foundational data engineering code for the NCAA Next Man Up project, establishing a repeatable and well-documented pipeline for ingesting, cleaning, and processing college basketball data.
- Successfully gained access to KenPom data and integrated it into the project workflow, including authentication and API usage for advanced team-level metrics.
- Created cleaned and processed CSV files from raw data sources (Sports Reference, KenPom) to produce analysis-ready datasets.
- Implemented structured Python scripts for schedules, rosters, team metrics, and four-factor statistics with consistent naming and configuration across seasons.
- Completed and submitted the required work session / workshop video demonstrating current code, data outputs, and project progress.
- Continued refining repository structure, documentation, and organization to support scalability and external review.

Problems:
- Still awaiting availability from Jay Flores due to in-season scheduling constraints, limiting direct stakeholder feedback.
- Some data sources require careful handling due to access limits, formatting inconsistencies, and automation constraints.
- Dashboard development is intentionally postponed until data pipelines and metric definitions are fully stabilized.

Plans:
- Schedule and conduct an initial working meeting with Jay Flores to validate analytics priorities and use cases.
- Expand data coverage to additional teams and seasons to support comparative analysis and “next man up” scenarios.
- Begin exploratory analysis and metric validation now that core data pipelines are established.
- Re-evaluate dashboard frameworks with a clearer understanding of data structure, scale, and user needs.

2026-01-26
Progress:
- Created a new GitHub repository for NCAA Next Man Up after identifying configuration issues with the original repo that prevented it from being public and properly shared.
- Added full repository structure, documentation files, and initial project content to the new repo.
- Finalized Capstone project proposal for submission.
- Continued early development work and began laying groundwork for a simple prototype to support future conversations with UM basketball staff.
- Began evaluating potential dashboard frameworks that integrate well with Python-based analytics and future data management needs.

Problems:
- Still determining the most appropriate dashboard application and architecture to balance flexibility, scalability, and ease of use.
- Awaiting scheduling availability from UM basketball staff due to in-season constraints.
- Had inital set up problems with GitHub Repo, but it is now up and working, and I may still have Andrew review this and see if this is what he wants.

Plans:
- Continue developing a basic working prototype to support early feedback and conversations with Jay Flores.
- Narrow down dashboard technology choice and overall system architecture.
- Further refine analytics focus and metrics based on initial stakeholder discussions.

2026-01-19
Progress:
- Created initial GitHub repository structure for the NCAA Next Man Up project.
- Began outlining project scope, goals, and overall analytics approach.
- Researched publicly available NCAA basketball data sources, including Sports Reference, ESPN, and KenPom, as potential primary contributors.
- Reached out to Jay Flores and Patricia Duce to begin conversations around project alignment, collaboration, and potential application.
- Began setting up initial code structure and exploratory development.

Problems:
- Still evaluating which data sources provide the most reliable and consistent access for automation and analysis.
- Client and Prospective Client details not fully finalized yet.

Plans:
- Finalize and submit Capstone project proposal.
- Continue refining GitHub structure and documentation.
- Attempt to schedule initial meetings with Jay Flores and Patricia Duce to further align project direction.
