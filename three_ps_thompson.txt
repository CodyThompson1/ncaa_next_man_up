Progress:
- Created a new GitHub repository for NCAA Next Man Up after identifying configuration issues with the original repo that prevented it from being public and properly shared.
- Added full repository structure, documentation files, and initial project content to the new repo.
- Finalized Capstone project proposal for submission.
- Continued early development work and began laying groundwork for a simple prototype to support future conversations with UM basketball staff.
- Began evaluating potential dashboard frameworks that integrate well with Python-based analytics and future data management needs.

Problems:
- Still determining the most appropriate dashboard application and architecture to balance flexibility, scalability, and ease of use.
- Awaiting scheduling availability from UM basketball staff due to in-season constraints.
- Had inital set up problems with GitHub Repo, but it is now up and working, and I may still have Andrew review this and see if this is what he wants.

Plans:
- Continue developing a basic working prototype to support early feedback and conversations with Jay Flores.
- Narrow down dashboard technology choice and overall system architecture.
- Further refine analytics focus and metrics based on initial stakeholder discussions.
