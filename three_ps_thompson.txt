Progress:
- Finalized foundational data engineering code for the NCAA Next Man Up project, establishing a repeatable and well-documented pipeline for ingesting, cleaning, and processing college basketball data.
- Successfully gained access to KenPom data and integrated it into the project workflow, including authentication and API usage for advanced team-level metrics.
- Created cleaned and processed CSV files from raw data sources (Sports Reference, KenPom) to produce analysis-ready datasets.
- Implemented structured Python scripts for schedules, rosters, team metrics, and four-factor statistics with consistent naming and configuration across seasons.
- Completed and submitted the required work session / workshop video demonstrating current code, data outputs, and project progress.
- Continued refining repository structure, documentation, and organization to support scalability and external review.

Problems:
- Still awaiting availability from Jay Flores due to in-season scheduling constraints, limiting direct stakeholder feedback.
- Some data sources require careful handling due to access limits, formatting inconsistencies, and automation constraints.
- Dashboard development is intentionally postponed until data pipelines and metric definitions are fully stabilized.

Plans:
- Schedule and conduct an initial working meeting with Jay Flores to validate analytics priorities and use cases.
- Expand data coverage to additional teams and seasons to support comparative analysis and “next man up” scenarios.
- Begin exploratory analysis and metric validation now that core data pipelines are established.
- Re-evaluate dashboard frameworks with a clearer understanding of data structure, scale, and user needs.

Progress:
- Created a new GitHub repository for NCAA Next Man Up after identifying configuration issues with the original repo that prevented it from being public and properly shared.
- Added full repository structure, documentation files, and initial project content to the new repo.
- Finalized Capstone project proposal for submission.
- Continued early development work and began laying groundwork for a simple prototype to support future conversations with UM basketball staff.
- Began evaluating potential dashboard frameworks that integrate well with Python-based analytics and future data management needs.

Problems:
- Still determining the most appropriate dashboard application and architecture to balance flexibility, scalability, and ease of use.
- Awaiting scheduling availability from UM basketball staff due to in-season constraints.
- Had inital set up problems with GitHub Repo, but it is now up and working, and I may still have Andrew review this and see if this is what he wants.

Plans:
- Continue developing a basic working prototype to support early feedback and conversations with Jay Flores.
- Narrow down dashboard technology choice and overall system architecture.
- Further refine analytics focus and metrics based on initial stakeholder discussions.

2026-01-19
Progress:
- Created initial GitHub repository structure for the NCAA Next Man Up project.
- Began outlining project scope, goals, and overall analytics approach.
- Researched publicly available NCAA basketball data sources, including Sports Reference, ESPN, and KenPom, as potential primary contributors.
- Reached out to Jay Flores and Patricia Duce to begin conversations around project alignment, collaboration, and potential application.
- Began setting up initial code structure and exploratory development.

Problems:
- Still evaluating which data sources provide the most reliable and consistent access for automation and analysis.
- Client and Prospective Client details not fully finalized yet.

Plans:
- Finalize and submit Capstone project proposal.
- Continue refining GitHub structure and documentation.
- Attempt to schedule initial meetings with Jay Flores and Patricia Duce to further align project direction.
